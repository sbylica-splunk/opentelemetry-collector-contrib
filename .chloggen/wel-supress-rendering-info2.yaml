# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: The 'raw' flag no longer suppresses rendering info.

# Mandatory: One or more tracking issues related to the change. You can use the PR number here if no issue exists.
issues: [34720]

# (Optional) One or more lines of additional information to render under the primary note.
# These lines will be padded with 2 spaces and then inserted directly into the document.
# Use pipe (|) for multiline entries.

  Previously, this flag controlled two behaviors simultaneously:
    1. Whether or not the body of the log record was an XML string or structured object.
    2. Whether or not rendering info was resolved.
  A separate 'suppress_rendering_info' option now controls rendering info resolution.
  This is considered a breaking change because users setting only the 'raw' flag without also setting the
  new 'suppress_rendering_info' flag may see a performance decrease along with more detailed events.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
